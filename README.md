# Adventure Time!

Oh no… Jake has gone missing! Follow Finn the human’s journey to Jake.
You will enter different surroundings with numerous characters. Ask them if they know of Jake’s whereabouts. 

This is a kind of labyrinth where an action may lead you to a dead end, and another may lead you forward.
You can return to the previous page and make another decision in order to find your way to Jake.

This project is mainly to get some training in PHP, HTML and CSS and how to integrate these into a whole.

More info to come… As well as a link the project on One.com.
